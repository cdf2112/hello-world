    "# Categorizing Profitable Free Mobile Apps\n",
    "\n",
    "Our discussion concerns mobile apps available for Android and Apple operating systems. In particular, we wish to uncover ideas for new mobile apps which are\n",
    "both **free** and **profitable**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Profitability of free apps is based on in-app adverstisements. Thus, the more users of a free app, the greater its actual or potential profitability. \n",
    "\n",
    "This simple principle leads us to our main strategies of analyzing existing apps:\n",
    "    1. What kinds of free apps have the most number of users?  \n",
    "       These are the apps we might wish to emulate as developers. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. What kinds of free apps have the fewest number of users?  \n",
    "       These are the categories of apps we might wish to avoid  \n",
    "       as developers. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. What kinds of paid apps are not well-represented among free apps?  \n",
    "       The idea is that free apps of this type could take future market  \n",
    "       share away from paid apps, and thus fulfill our profitability goal    \n",
    "       of having a large number of users. \n",
    "    \n",
    "We are going to dig into two different data sets for mobile apps. One set contains data for Android apps ([link here](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/googleplaystore.csv)), and the other for iOS apps ([link here](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/AppleStore.csv)). The basics of Python programming language for data analysis will be put to use. We explain everything step-by-step and try to justify our conclusions. "

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the last two tables, we see that apps in the categories of communication, social, and video players are at or near the top of both lists for android. But if we develop such an app for android, what are the chances it will be successful if we add it to the Apple Play store? Clearly, social apps are a good candidate for both platforms, because this genre of app appears at or near the top of all three lists. Also, video players are fairly successful as free apps on both platforms--notice 'Photo and Video\" appears in 6th place (out of 23) in the Apple Store list above. \n",
    "\n",
    "To continue this reasoning in a systematic way, we visually inspect the three tables to find free apps that we might want to develop. First, we identify app categories that land in the top 10 list in **both** the Google Play Categories and Apple Store Genres tables. Results:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Social \n",
    "    - Video Players\n",
    "    - Photography\n",
    "    - Travel\n",
    "    - Game\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we analyzed the Google Play data in two ways, let's also see which kinds of apps land in the top 10 list in both the Google Play Genres list and Apple Store Genre tables. A little thought is involved to find overlapping genres, for example \"Action And Adventure\" would overlap with \"Games.\" Results:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Video Players & Editors\n",
    "    - Social\n",
    "    - Games\n",
    "        - Adventure; Action & Adventure\n",
    "        - Arcade\n",
    "        - Puzzle; Action & Adventure\n",
    "\n",
    "As developers of free profitable apps, we could develop a free app in any of the categories above with a good potential for success. There are 5 general categories in all, and all fall under the category of \"fun\" apps versus \"reference\" or other \"dry\" categories. One way to proceed would be to choose one of these 5 categories we are knowledgeable about or interested in, and develop an associated app for the android platform. But despite the fact that these are popular apps, we will still face competition from similar apps in the app stores. Therefore, we might be better off selecting the app category from the list that has the fewest number of competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already produced tables that list the number of apps available in each category, that is, how much competition an app might face. (Let's refer to these as competition tables, with the competition greatest at the top.) \"Games\" and \"Social\" appear very near the top of at least one competition table, so we will avoid these genres. That leaves \"Video\", \"Photography\" and \"Travel\" to think about. But \"Photo & Video\" appears in third place in the competition table for the Apple Store, so that may not be our most promising choice either. That leaves only \"Travel\", which appears at least halfway down the competition tables for Google Category and Apple Genre. Moreover, \"Travel\" also appears fairly far down in the competition table for Google Genre. This is exactly what we want for less competition! Bingo! Our data analysis has honed in on \"Travel.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, a **free travel app** is a solid choice for both profitability and success in the Google Play and Apple Store. "
